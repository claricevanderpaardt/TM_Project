    "# Text Mining Final Project: A Book Recommender System\n",
    "__Andrea Valderrey, Tereza Odysseos, Anne Marijn Coers & Clarice van der Paardt__\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to compare the genre relevance of recommendations generated by three different recommender systems (description-based, rating-based, and combined) with genres of recommendations from Goodreads. Our motivation lies in producing a recommendation system that aligns in terms of genre with Goodreads' system, a widely used platform for book recommendations. Using the extensive Goodreads book dataset from Kaggle, containing over 10 million entries, we will preprocess the data and develop three distinct models. By evaluating the effectiveness of each model in providing personalized book recommendations aligned with user genre preferences, we aim to identify which model performs best in this task. This comparison will shed light on which feature (description or ratings) contributes more significantly to the quality of recommendations, thereby providing insights for optimizing recommendation systems to improve genre alignment.\n",
